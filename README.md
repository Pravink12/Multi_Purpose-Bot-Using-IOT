# Multi_Purpose-Bot-Using-IOT
An IoT-based smart vehicle bot using ESP32 with GPS and GSM for real-time location tracking and alert messaging. It also features obstacle detection using IR sensors and metal detection using an NPN sensor for security and surveillance applications.

# IoT-Based Smart Vehicle Bot with GPS & GSM
This project is an IoT-based smart vehicle bot designed for real-time location tracking, obstacle detection, and metal detection. The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller integrated with GPS and GSM modules to provide live tracking and alert messaging, making it suitable for security, surveillance, and military-related applications.

## Components Used
- ESP32 Microcontroller  
- GPS Module (Location Tracking)  
- GSM Module (SMS Alerts)  
- NPN Sensor (Metal Detection)  
- IR Sensor (Obstacle Detection)  
- Motor Driver  
- DC Motors  
- Battery & Power Supply  
- Vehicle Chassis  

## Features
- Real-time GPS location tracking  
- SMS alerts using GSM module  
- Metal detection using NPN sensor  
- Obstacle detection using IR sensor  
- Autonomous vehicle movement  
- IoT-based monitoring  

## Working Principle
The ESP32 acts as the main controller of the vehicle bot. It continuously collects data from the GPS module, IR sensor, and metal detection sensor.  
- GPS provides the current location coordinates  
- GSM sends alert messages with location details  
- IR sensor detects obstacles and helps avoid collisions  
- NPN sensor detects metallic objects  

All sensor data is processed by the ESP32 to control the vehicle’s movement and communication.


## Applications
- Military and defense surveillance  
- Vehicle tracking systems  
- Security and monitoring  
- Smart transportation  
- Search and detection operations  

## Technologies Used
- Embedded Systems  
- Internet of Things (IoT)  
- ESP32 (Arduino Framework)  
- GPS & GSM Communication
